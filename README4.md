# 🚀 Week 4 - Interneers Lab  

This week, we focused on **joining schemas in our database**. We introduced a **ProductCategory** model and linked it to the **Product** model using a **foreign key (ReferenceField)** in MongoDB.  

By the end of this week, we successfully:  
✅ Established relationships between products and categories  
✅ Implemented CRUD operations for categories  
✅ Added filters for fetching products  
✅ Migrated existing products to the new category structure

# 🛠️ **Step 1: Add ProductCategory Model**  
We added a `ProductCategory` model to `models.py` and modified the **Product** model's `category` field:  

```python
from mongoengine import Document, StringField, ReferenceField, FloatField

class ProductCategory(Document):
    name = StringField(required=True, unique=True)

class Product(Document):
    name = StringField(required=True)
    price = FloatField(required=True)
    category = ReferenceField(ProductCategory, reverse_delete_rule=2)  # CASCADE
🔹 Reverse Delete Rule Options:

reverse_delete_rule=2 (CASCADE): Deletes all related products if a category is removed.

reverse_delete_rule=3 (NULLIFY): Keeps products even if their category is deleted.

🛠️ Step 2: Implement CRUD for Product Categories
We created two new files:

🔹 product_category_repository.py
Handles database operations:

python
Copy
Edit
def create_category(name):
    category = ProductCategory(name=name)
    category.save()
    return category
🔹 product_category_services.py
Fetches all products under a category:

python
Copy
Edit
def get_products_by_category(category_id):
    return Product.objects(category=category_id)
🛠️ Step 3: Update product_repository.py
🔹 Enhancements:
✅ When creating a product, if a new category is provided, it gets added to the database.
✅ While updating a product, if the category doesn't exist, it raises an error.
✅ Added methods to add and remove products in a category.

python
Copy
Edit
def add_product_to_category(product_id, category_id):
    product = Product.objects(id=product_id).first()
    if product:
        product.category = category_id
        product.save()
🛠️ Step 4: Add Validations
✅ Used DRF Serializers to validate requests.
✅ Set branding to null for existing products without branding.

🛠️ Step 5: Update Views and URLs
✅ Modified views.py to handle all API changes.
✅ Updated urls.py to include new category-related routes.

🔥 Advanced Tasks
✅ Step 1: Seed Categories
File: seed_categories.py
Ensures all products without a category get assigned a default category when the server starts.

Run it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m products_mongo.seed_categories
✅ Step 2: Implement Rich Filters
File: product_services.py
Added advanced filtering options:

python
Copy
Edit
def filter_products(category=None, name=None, price_min=None, price_max=None, brand=None):
    query = Product.objects()
    if category:
        query = query.filter(category=category)
    if name:
        query = query.filter(name__icontains=name)
    if price_min and price_max:
        query = query.filter(price__gte=price_min, price__lte=price_max)
    if brand:
        query = query.filter(brand=brand)
    return query
🔹 Supports filtering by:
✅ Category
✅ Name
✅ Price range
✅ Brand

✅ Step 3: Migrate Products Without a Category
File: product_migrations.py
Moves products without a category into a default category.

Run it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m products_mongo.migrate_products
🎯 Final Thoughts
By the end of this week, we successfully implemented category-based product management, improved query capabilities with rich filters, and ensured smooth data migration. 🚀🔥
